Avalanche is a verical-scroller game. The player wins by dropping to the
bottommost platform. They lose if the avalanche touches them.

The game starts with a main menu from which you can either begin the
game or view instructions.

The platforms are generated within random locations, the screen scrolls
vertically as the player descends. I included wraparound so that if a
player wanders off screen, they will reappear on the opposite side of
the screen, but still on the same floor. I also added in music,
sound when falling, win/lose screens, snowfall, a second level,
backgrounds, and running animations. A sound will play when the
user beats or loses a level as well.


# How To Install:

The game runs on Python3 and PyGame.

From the root directory, enter the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.

Next, start the game with `python3 beta/main.py`.

Enjoy!
